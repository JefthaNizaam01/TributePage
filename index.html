      <blockquote>
        <p>"True courage requires not only strength of will but strength of belief. What motivated Nelson Mandela and drove him to risk his life for freedom was a burning passion that, irrespective of colour, race and background, all people are created equal and his list of historic achievements starts with a multiracial South Africa."</p>
      </blockquote>


      <p><strong>Nelson Mandela</strong> was a South African anti-apartheid revolutionary, politician, and philanthropist who served as President of South Africa from 1994 to 1999. He was the country's first black head of state and the first elected in a fully representative democratic election.
